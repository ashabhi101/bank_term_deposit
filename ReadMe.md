5. Attribute information:

   For more information, read [Moro et al., 2014].

   Input variables:
   # bank client data:
   1 - age (numeric)
   2 - job : type of job (categorical: "admin.","blue-collar","entrepreneur","housemaid","management","retired","self-employed","services","student","technician","unemployed","unknown")
   3 - marital : marital status (categorical: "divorced","married","single","unknown"; note: "divorced" means divorced or widowed)
   4 - education (categorical: "basic.4y","basic.6y","basic.9y","high.school","illiterate","professional.course","university.degree","unknown")
   5 - default: has credit in default? (categorical: "no","yes","unknown")
   6 - housing: has housing loan? (categorical: "no","yes","unknown")
   7 - loan: has personal loan? (categorical: "no","yes","unknown")
   # related with the last contact of the current campaign:
   8 - contact: contact communication type (categorical: "cellular","telephone") 
   9 - month: last contact month of year (categorical: "jan", "feb", "mar", ..., "nov", "dec")
  10 - day_of_week: last contact day of the week (categorical: "mon","tue","wed","thu","fri")
  11 - duration: last contact duration, in seconds (numeric). Important note:  this attribute highly affects the output target (e.g., if duration=0 then y="no"). Yet, the duration is not known before a call is performed. Also, after the end of the call y is obviously known. Thus, this input should only be included for benchmark purposes and should be discarded if the intention is to have a realistic predictive model.
   # other attributes:
  12 - campaign: number of contacts performed during this campaign and for this clientJob (numeric, includes last contact)
  13 - pdays: number of days that passed by after the client was last contacted from a previous campaign (numeric; 999 means client was not previously contacted)
  14 - previous: number of contacts performed before this campaign and for this client (numeric)
  15 - poutcome: outcome of the previous marketing campaign (categorical: "failure","nonexistent","success")
   # social and economic context attributes
  16 - emp.var.rate: employment variation rate - quarterly indicator (numeric)
  17 - cons.price.idx: consumer price index - monthly indicator (numeric)     
  18 - cons.conf.idx: consumer confidence index - monthly indicator (numeric)     
  19 - euribor3m: euribor 3 month rate - daily indicator (numeric)
  20 - nr.employed: number of employees - quarterly indicator (numeric)

  Output variable (desired target):
  21 - y - has the client subscribed a term deposit? (binary: "yes","no")

6. Missing Attribute Values: There are several missing values in some categorical attributes, all coded with the "unknown" label. These missing values can be treated as a possible class label or using deletion or imputation techniques. 

7. Model Architecture:
    1. EDA.ipynb - contains all the exploratory work about the dataset for valuable insights, explained clearly in the notebook
    2. Preprocessing.ipynb - contains step to deal with the data, like 
        Splitting data into train, test and cross validation
        Feature engineering - One hot encoding
        Feature selection - left it to the model initially
    3. model.ipynb - Contains two models built using sklerarn and xgboost, and the models are saved for production code 
        The reason I chose these models is since they are ensemble models, they typically do well thana. Single model. This is a great place to start buildig models.
   
Future scope:
 I plan to convert existing model to production grade and tune the hyperparameters better.
